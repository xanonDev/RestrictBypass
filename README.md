# RestrictBypass
website written in python using Flask to bypass restrictions such as internet provider or parental controls etc.
##how to use 
1. go to <a href="restrictbypass.xanondev.repl.co">restrictbypass.xanondev.repl.co</a>
2. paste the link to the website you want to open into the text field, e.g. https://www.youtube.com
3. click bypass
alternative you can import this repository to your repo on replit
##how it's working?
a python script hosted on replica (or on your server) downloads the website on the server side
then returns it as a coded js script to the user
the js script is coded to bypass filtering by words or content
therefore, the entire website is built from a client-side script
##warning
some pages may not display correctly
I'm working to fix it
and using it may not please your boss or teacher or internet provider
you use at your own risk
